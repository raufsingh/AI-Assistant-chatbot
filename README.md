## Features
- Uses **Microsoft Phi-1.5** for natural language understanding.
- Interactive chatbot interface built with **Gradio**.
- Runs on **CPU** or **GPU**, depending on availability.

## Usage
- Enter a health-related question in the chat input.
- The AI will generate a relevant response.
- Useful for general health queries (not a replacement for professional medical advice).

## Dependencies
- `gradio`
- `torch`
- `transformers`
  
## Possible Improvements
üí° Fine-tuning on medical datasets for better domain-specific accuracy
üí° Integrating retrieval-based responses to include factual information from reliable sources
üí° Adding voice-to-text support for a more interactive experience
